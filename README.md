# The "Drop" ASIC

ASIC audio visual demo in less than 4000 Logic Gates.
No CPU, no GPU, no memory. Racing the beam straight to VGA 640x480.

Entry to Tiny Tapeout Demoscene 2024 September competition: https://tinytapeout.com/competitions/demoscene/

Taped out on [SKY130](https://github.com/rejunity/tt08-vga-drop/tree/sky130), [IHP130](https://github.com/rejunity/tt08-vga-drop/tree/ihp130) and *coming soon* [GF180](https://github.com/rejunity/tt08-vga-drop/tree/ttgf0p2) process.
